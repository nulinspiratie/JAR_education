# Drone assembly

## General tips when assembling a drone
- Heavy items should be low. This will lower the center of mass and will help stabilize the drone.
- Distribute the weight evenly. This will keep the drone stable.
- Make sure that the propellors can spin freely. There should be no cables that the propellers can touch.

## Motors and electronic speed controllers (ESC's)
The propellers of the drone are powered by motors, which are controlled by electronic speed controllers (ESC's).
The further the distance of the motors from the center of the drone, the more stable the drone will be.
The motors should be attached to the top plate of the drone, and should be screwed in with at least two screws
